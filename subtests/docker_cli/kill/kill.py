Summary
----------

Several variations of running the kill command.

*  random_* - series of random signals
*  run_sigproxy* - instead of ``docker kill`` uses ``kill`` directly on the
   ``docker run`` process
*  attach_sigproxy* - instead of ``docker kill`` uses ``kill`` on
    ``docker attach`` process
